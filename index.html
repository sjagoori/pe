        <p>Looking at the hotdog as PE means, that the core elements of the sandwich should be of good quality. This is because there are people that only want the meat and the bun, or people that can only have the meat and the bun. These people might be very allergic to ketchup, mayonnaise and/or dried onions. For these people the core elements need to be good, so they can have a good meal experience. </p>

        <p>Some people like to just add ketchup and mustard to their hotdog, they find it improves the taste, hence improving the overall hotdog experience. But they don't want to have or can't have the fancy toppings.</p>
